  abstract = {Most commercially-available robots are either aimed at the research
community, or are designed with a single purpose in mind.  The
extensive hobbyist community has tended to focus on the hardware and
the low-level software aspects.  We claim that there is a need for a
low-cost, general-purpose robot, accessible to the hobbyist community,
with sufficient computation and sensing to run ``research-grade''
software.  In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of
such a robot.  We explicitly outline our design goals, and show how a
capable robot can be assembled from off-the-shelf parts, for a modest
cost, by a single person with only a few tools.  We also show how the
robot can be used as a low-cost telepresence platform, giving the
system a concrete purpose beyond being a low-cost development
platform.},

  abstract = {Telepresence robots are becoming increasingly popular
and are increasingly ready to enter use in the real world as stand-ins
for remote humans. It is useful, but currently uncommon,
to provide the human operator with an approximation of peripheral
vision and the ability to saccade around the scene. We have developed
an interface which provides peripheral vision to a remote operator
by using a motorized pan-tilt camera to create a panorama, and enables
the operator to move the camera's gaze within that panorama.},
